
# Calculator

A beautiful, responsive, and functional web-based calculator with a **cute glassmorphism** aesthetic  
Soft pink & cream palette · backdrop-filter magic · real-time preview display

---

##  Features

### Interface & Design
- Glassmorphism UI with **backdrop-filter** blur + soft shadows
- **Dual display** system
  - Preview: shows full expression / previous result
  - Main: focused on current number or final answer
- Responsive across mobile, tablet & desktop (using `clamp()` + media queries)

### Smart Calculator Logic
- Prevents multiple decimal points in one number
- Supports leading negative numbers (e.g. -5 + 3)
- Smart operator replacement (type + then - → replaces automatically)
- Proper percentage handling (e.g. 200 + 15% = 230)

### Input & Accessibility
- Full **physical keyboard support** (numbers, operators, Enter, Escape, Backspace)
- Semantic HTML5 + ARIA labels
- Smooth real-time updates & clean state management
